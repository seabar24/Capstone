# IoT Devices on Wifi 5 vs. Wifi 6 Decomposition
This is a decomposition of my Cpastone Idea about IoT Devices using Wifi 5 vs. Wifi 6. What follows is a mindmup and outline for the project.

# Outline

# IoT Devices
Making a list of IoT Devices to look into. Will be somewhat complex overall, but hopefully not too bad.

## Compatible with Wifi 6
I think with Wifi 6 having been out since 2019, that there will hopefully be plenty of devices that are Wifi 6 capable to run it and be able to test.

## Cost of IoT Devices
I think cost of the devices will be the most difficult part of from IoT devices, besides how the IoT Devices will work and function within the network.

# Research
Researching into how the IoT Devices work, how Wifi works, and getting it all to work together will be a difficult undertaking.

## Understanding Wifi Routing and Networking
Wifi is going to be similar hopefully to routing within our lab environments, though will take on a whole new complexity with physical setup.

## IoT Devices
Researching into IoT Devices will be less difficult as there may be contacts at Leahy Center such as Tom C. who have an understanding of IoT devices. May ask for help from Leahy Center and Tom C. for research and understanding into this.

# Wifi 5 + 6

## Wifi 5

### Comparison w/ Wifi 6
This would involve the report section for the final deliverable of the Capstone. Doing a comparison between speed, latency, encryption strength, and etc. between Wifi 5 and 6.

### Contrasts w/ Wifi 6
Similar to the Comparison, this will be for the report as the final deliverable. Writing where they contrast in the fields of speed, latency, encryption strength, and etc.

## Cost of Routers
Cost of routers shouldn't be too much. Doing a quick search on google found to be reasonably priced. Though may work with Leahy Center about collaboration and getting funding for this.

## Wifi 6 Router
Seeing the differences and setup for a Wifi 6 router may be different than normal routers. Will have to research into this.

# Creation of Network
Creating the networked environment may be diificult especially since it's not the same as VMWare. Though hopefully isn't too complex with only routing a some IoT Devices and making it akin to a Home Network.

## Configuring Network
This would require the most technical part of making sure all connections can be made and knowing how to set up network. When the time comes after research, will make a network diagram before testing.

## Cost of Network Cables
Self explanatory, gonna need network cables in order to setup network which will cost some. Might partner with Leahy Center to get funding and help on this end.
