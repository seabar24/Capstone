## Deliverable Statement
Sprint 3 will mainly be focused on tweaking the previously default/baselined Wifi settings and doing Wifi Hacking from the different versions. The tweaks will be for network speeds, latency, bandwidth, channel size, and etc. While Wifi Hacking will involve De-authentication hacking between the different encryption methods for Wifi - WPA2/3. This sprint will also involve setting up `Medium` for blog posts/final deliverable for sprint going over my conclusive thoughts of the project as a whole.
## Objectives
- Tweak settings for each version of Wifi
- Do a live, control, and hacked recording of each version of Wifi and testing for WPA2/3
- Finalize IoT Devices for Capstone and have them in. 

## Discrete Tasks
- Meeting with Joe Eastman
- Weekly Reflection
- Update Kanban/Github (Add repeatable tasks for baseline of devices)
- Prep for Wifi Hack with TCP Dump
- Research into Wifi testing frameworks to work around
- Finalize purchases and shipping of all hardware needed by end of this sprint.
