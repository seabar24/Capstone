## Capstone Project ideas
* Project idea 1 - Optimizing IoT Devices with 802.11ax and Comparison/Contrast of v4, v5, v6.
  * **Topic Definition**: IoT Devices are prevalent in todays world and need a way to be secured for customers. Usually these IoT devices will be on customer's home wifi, with these devices being on Wifi 4 or 5. Wifi 6 is coming with a more secure encryption and faster speeds, and this capstone aims to see how IoT devies can be optimized with Wifi 6. While also comparing and contrasting older versions of 802.11. This would be comparing speeds, encryption methods, accessibility, and etc. Testing for vulnerabilites from older versions and v6. This can be used as a selling point to a client for why they should purchase or switch over to Wifi 6.
  * **Overview**: I'm interested in this topic as Wifi 6 is still relatively new and slowly being rolled out into devices. I wish to get ahead and start to seeing how to properly optimize commonly used IoT devices for Wifi 6, as Wifi 4 and 5 will eventually be phased out. 
  * **Description**: I plan on researching into IoT devices that are Wifi 6 compatibile and see how speeds and encryption can be optimized on the IoT Devices. As well as getting Wifi 6 routers to make a small network simulating a home wifi. Using an antenna to monitor traffic. Use a Kali machine to try and run Wifi attacks against the network.
