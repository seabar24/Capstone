## Capstone Project ideas
* Project idea 1 - Optimizing IoT Devices using Wifi 6
  * **Topic Definition**: IoT Devices are prevalent in todays world and need a way to be secured for customers. Usually these IoT devices will be on customer's home wifi, with these devices being on Wifi 4 or 5. Wifi 6 is coming with a more secure encryption and faster speeds, and this capstone aims to see how IoT devies can be optimized with Wifi 6.
  * **Overview**: I'm interested in this topic as Wifi 6 is still relatively new and slowly being rolled out into devices. I wish to get ahead and start to seeing how to properly optimize commonly used IoT devices for Wifi 6, as Wifi 4 and 5 will eventually be phased out. 
  * **Description**: I plan on researching into IoT devices that are Wifi 6 compatibile and see how speeds and encryption can be optimized on the IoT Devices. As well as getting Wifi 6 routers to make a small network simulating a home wifi. 

* Project Idea 2 - Comparison of IoT Devices using Wifi 5 vs. Wifi 6
  * **Topic Definition**: This would be more of continuation of Project Idea 1 to make a comparison report on IoT Devices when connected to Wifi 5 vs. Wifi 6. This would be comparing speeds, encryption methods, accessibility, and etc. This can be used as a selling point to a client for why they should purchase or switch over to Wifi 6.
  * **Overview**: Similar to the othe Project Idea. I would go down this path if I can feasibly get the Project Idea 1 done. I'd be interested in seeing how Wifi 6 works in comparison to Wifi 5.
  * **Description**: This would require research into IoT Devices. Purchasing of Wifi 6 and Wifi 5 router and connecting to IoT devices to compare and contrast. 

* Project Idea 3 - Ransomware Defense for Small Organizations (Client: Adam G./Leahy Center)
  * **Topic Definition**: Small organizations including non-profits, schools, and local government agencies have been severely impacted by ransomware attacks.  This project would involve research into ransomware methods - and effective defensive strategies with a focus on organizations that have limited IT expertise and resource constraints.  Deliverables would include both technical and procedural best practice guides, development of a training seminar, and likely working with some local organizations to directly improve their defensive/recovery capabilities.
  * **Overview**: Having my background in CNCS, I'd like to demonstrate my abiltiies in researching and implementing defensive cyber security methods as well as selling this to clients.
  * **Description**: This would eb doing research into security methods and the organizations I'd be working with. As well as making a report on my findings and where improvements can be made for the client.
