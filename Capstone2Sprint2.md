## Deliverable Statement
The purpose of this sprint is to get a baseline of the IoT devices connected to the network. The settings for the APs will be at their "normal" settings, testing the different: radio frequencies, channel widths, uplink/download, and speeds. This is so for Sprint 3 + 4, I can compare and contrast the different settings when they are "tweaked". This sprint will include purchasing the IoT devices, fixing previouss issues (such as AP problems), and baselining the devices connected.
## Objectives
- Baseline of Devices (I.e. Having device download, uplink, bandwidth, and speeds recorded for "normal" settings)
- Fix issues from First Sprint
- Purchase IoT devices for Baseline
- Update Github page.
## Discrete Tasks
- Meeting with Joe Eastman
- Weekly Reflection
- Update Kanban/Github (Add repeatable tasks for baseline of devices)
- Get software for recording basline
