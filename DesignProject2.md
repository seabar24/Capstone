# Design Project 2 - Optimizing IoT Devices with 802.11ax and Comparison/Contrast of v4, v5, v6.
> This will be a continuation of Design Project 1. This will will be nailing down on the network design, hardware, costs, and final research into the project for IoT Devices using Wifi 6, as well as testing for vulnerabilities within previous iterations of v4 and v5. The final deliverable will still be a fianl report of my findings.

## Project Information

* [Project Milestone](https://github.com/seabar24/Capstone/milestone/2)
* [Project Kanban](https://github.com/users/seabar24/projects/2/views/3)

## Tasks

### Week 1

* Research into software that can track the metrics for the Wifi 6 connections has been found. My main two ideas were OpenWrt and ath11k, with OpenWrt being a Linux OS and ath11k being a Linux Driver.
* Hardware research into possible Wifi 6 Access Point to use, known as Aruba.
* **Tasks to Do for Next Week:** Network Design, 2 pages for Written proposal, Meet with Katheryn and Joe.

### Week 2

* [Network Diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RGTPOfMt0mzl4Y3BG0U2a9DHe11l-UiV/view?usp=drive_link) is done, though as project goes along, may update it.
* Met with Joe Eastman. Going to continue with project and may meet a 2nd time for a progress update on project before end of Sprint 2.
* **Tasks to Do for Next Week:**
