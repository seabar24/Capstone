This is a folder for when two or more devices are connected to Wifi 6 AP (U6-Pro). 

It shows off the download speeds for Wifi 6 for baseline using the tool known as "iperf".

Each file is based off a different channel Width from within the 5GHz radio waves. 

So for example, "wifi6_iphone_20w" would be the Wifi 6 AP, iPhone connection, and the channel width is 20.
